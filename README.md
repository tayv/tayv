### Hello üëã

I'm a Product/UX Designer that spends my days making enterprise security software easier to use. This is the place to view some of my personal coding projects that I complete in my free time. Professional design portfolio available upon request.

#### üîß Things I'm working on:

- [Project Bubblegum](https://github.com/tayv/Project-Bubblegum). An adventure in learning to use Nextjs, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS to develop reusable form components and UI patterns.


#### üå± Things I'm learning:

- Typescript, MySQL databases (through PlanetScale), and React + Nextjs.

### Past projects:

## What is parkadoo?
This was an experimental project to help people understand Edmonton parking laws better and create a letter that can help with the appeal process. There are three letter types plus the ability to proactively avoid parking tickets:

1. Public parking ticket appeal
2. Private parking lot appeal
3. Neighbour complaint/warning
4. Quickly check list of city bylaws to see if you're likely to get a ticket

## Philosophy

### Design
- Many form-based wizards are inflexible and frustrating to use, particularly on mobile devices. This project sought to explore a more fluid user experience by mimicking native messaging apps. 
- Key experimental design pattern: 
  + Allowing the step-by-step wizard to update active section via buttons but also on scroll. See example section below for video.
  + For context this project began in 2019 when scroll based interaction patterns were more unusual, especially for forms. Nowadays it's fairly common to see form/survey products utilizing some variation of scroll-based interactions.

### Code
- Goal was to reduce external dependencies as much as possible. Uses vanilla JS, CSS, HTML
- Use es6 modules instead of Node.js require
- Privacy and offline first. User data is not collected and user answers are saved to user's device and clears after their browsing session ends

## UI examples

### Checking bylaws

- Make it easier to check bylaws by using providing a list, summarizing in plain language, and linking to official bylaw.

### Appeal letter (city)

- Appeal letter page gives links to next steps, common letter actions, and a letter preview

### Scrolling

- Goal was to mimic the fluidity of a native messaging by having current step update as user scrolls up/down

## What is MK1?
MK1 is a Mario Kart race league started during the Covid-19 pandemic. This project was a way for me to learn React by creating a visual leaderboard that could be used by the league to better track race results. 


## Philosophy

### Design

- Design is not polished. This was primarily a coding project with minimal time spent refining visual design or interaction patterns.
- Goal: Follow standard race league leaderboards while also allowing users the ability to quickly see rankings by season as well as all-time results.
- Logo designed by Steve A.
- If I ever have time the Avatars will be updated to pixel art.
- Pixel art background created by me using Figma

### Code

- Uses React for the UI and Google Sheets API to host/update data. 
- There's a known async rendering issue with season results on initial page load. Can be fixed by triggering a re-render using the season dropdown.
