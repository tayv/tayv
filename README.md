### Hello 👋

**tayv/tayv** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- Project Bubblegum. An adventure in learning to use Nextjs, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS to develop reusable form components and UI patterns.


🌱 I’m currently focused on learning:

- Typescript, MySQL databases (through PlanetScale), and React.
